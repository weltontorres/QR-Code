# QR code (Frontend Mentor Challenge)

Hello! Thanks for coming and read about my accomplishment.

This challenge is a basic level, but as a beginner, I found some difficulties that prevented me from completing the task faster.

The greatest difficulty that I encountered was that I could not align the elements in the center of the screen. Even after using the "flex-box" features, the elements refused to be centered.

After some research I found that the problem was in the "background-color". Unlike the default html, the background-color needs adjustment in its height. So, by setting the height to 100% in the body, automatically the whole problem was solved.

To center the elements inside the div container, I left the default height, changed the width to 250px and put the padding=15px. This was necessary because I also found problems at the beginning because of the white background-color applied to div container.

I know this exercise is basic, but it was very important to me. I learned even more about the placement of elements.

Thank you for reading this far.
